### Architecture 🏗️
This application leverages [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles: </br>
-  _presentation(ui)_: Android module **MVVM**-based. It contains the Android UI framework components (Activitie, Fragments, ViewModels...). This module just observes data coming from the undelying modules through Kotlin Flows and displays it.
-  _domain_:
   * **Use Cases**: Platform-independent business logic;
   * **Models**: Platform-independent business models;
   * **Repository Interfaces**: Act as abstract definitions for data operations, following the Repository pattern to isolate domain logic from data source implementations;
-  _data_: Android module that acts as the **Single-Source-Of-Truth (SSOT)** of the App. It contains Repositories implementation, the Room Entities for persistence, the data source Api implementations and the corresponding api-specific models.
-  _di_: It contains all the dependency injection related classes and interfaces.

### MVVM Architecture Pattern 🔄

The application implements the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which provides:

- Clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic
- Improved testability through the separation of UI and business logic
- Better state management and data consistency
- Lifecycle-aware components

The MVVM implementation consists of:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application
- **View**: Represents the UI layer (Activities/Fragments) that observes ViewModel
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between Model and View, managing UI-related data and business logic

The ViewModel communicates with the View through data streams, maintaining a clear separation between the UI and business logic layers.

## 🤔 Why Android View System and not Compose?
Despite the growing popularity of Jetpack Compose, over 80% of existing Android applications are still built on the View System. Large companies (banks, telecom operators, government services) continue to use XML layouts due to stability, well-established legacy code handling, and high migration costs to Compose. The ability to work with the View System remains a critical skill, as the majority of job opportunities in the market (especially in the enterprise sector) require experience with this technology.

## 🤔 Why Dagger 2 and not Hilt/Koin?
Dagger 2 remains the de facto standard for dependency injection in large Android projects, being used by companies like Google, Amazon, and most banking applications. While Hilt and Koin offer simpler APIs, about 65% of enterprise projects still use Dagger 2 due to its performance (code generation instead of reflection), configuration flexibility, and time-tested stability. Knowledge of Dagger 2 makes a developer more competitive in the market, especially in the segment of high-paying positions in large companies.

## 📊 Key Statistics
- 80% of Android apps use View System
- 65% of enterprise projects use Dagger 2
- Most Fortune 500 companies still maintain View-based apps
- Highest paying positions often require View System & Dagger 2 experience
